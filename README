Team Status
========================

Seed
--------------------------------
rake threadsafe:disabled db:setup

Tech Goodies
--------------------------------
UI 
- Twitter Bootstrap
- Backbone
- Websockets to sync across clients
Backend
- Inherited Resource (for resful interface)
- Devise (for login management)

How to test it?
--------------------------------
Admin login: admin@example.com / please
Other users: user{n}example.com / please

Tested on Chrome and Firefox

1. start 2 browsers and login different accounts
2. update status on one account and should see both UI updated.

TODO
--------------------------------
Originally I followed TDD but I became hard as both backbone and websockets are new to me. 
More cucumebr tests should be added.
